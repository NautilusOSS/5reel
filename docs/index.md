# 5reel Smart Contract Documentation

## Overview

5reel is a comprehensive slot machine gaming platform built on the Algorand blockchain using Algorand Python and the ARC4 standard. The system consists of multiple interconnected smart contracts that provide a complete gaming experience with yield-bearing token mechanics.

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture consisting of several key components:

- **SlotMachine**: Main gaming contract that combines all functionality
- **ReelManager**: Manages slot machine reels and grid generation
- **SpinManager**: Handles betting, spinning, and payout logic
- **BankManager**: Manages contract balances and financial operations
- **YieldBearingToken**: ERC-20 compatible token with yield generation
- **Base Contracts**: Ownable, Bootstrapped, and Touchable interfaces

## Core Contracts

#### Balance Tracking

The BankManager maintains three balance types:

- **Available Balance**: Funds available for immediate use
- **Locked Balance**: Funds reserved for potential payouts
- **Total Balance**: Total funds in the contract

### YieldBearingToken

An ERC-20 compatible token that generates yield from the slot machine profits.

#### Methods

##### `bootstrap()`
Initializes the token with configurable name and symbol.

##### `set_name(name: Bytes32)`
Sets the token name (owner only).

##### `set_symbol(symbol: Bytes8)`
Sets the token symbol (owner only).

##### `deposit() -> UInt256`
Deposits funds and mints shares based on the current exchange rate.

**Cost**: 28,500 microAlgos for first-time users (box creation)

##### `withdraw(amount: UInt256) -> UInt64`
Burns shares and returns the corresponding asset amount.

##### `set_yield_bearing_source(app_id: UInt64)`
Sets the slot machine contract as the yield source.

##### `revoke_yield_bearing_source(new_owner: Address)`
Revokes the yield bearing source by transferring ownership to a new owner.

**Parameters**:
- `new_owner`: The new owner address for the yield source contract

**Note**: This method transfers ownership of the yield source contract away from the token contract

##### `burn_yield_fuse()`
Burns the yield fuse, preventing further yield source modifications.

**Note**: This is an irreversible operation that permanently disables yield source changes

##### `burn_stakeable_fuse()`
Burns the stakeable fuse, disabling staking functionality.

**Note**: This is an irreversible operation that permanently disables staking features

##### `burn_upgradeable_fuse()`
Burns the upgradeable fuse, preventing future contract upgrades.

**Note**: This is an irreversible operation that permanently locks the contract version

#### Yield Mechanics

The token implements a share-based yield system:

1. Users deposit funds into the token contract
2. Funds are forwarded to the slot machine
3. Shares are minted based on the deposit amount and current exchange rate
4. Profits from the slot machine increase the underlying asset value
5. Users can withdraw their proportional share of the total assets

## Events

The smart contracts emit various events to track important state changes and user interactions. These events provide transparency, enable real-time monitoring, and support analytics and auditing.

**Key Events**:
- **BetPlaced**: Emitted when a new bet is placed
- **BetClaimed**: Emitted when a bet is claimed and payout calculated
- **arc200_Transfer**: Standard token transfer events for the yield token

For comprehensive event documentation including monitoring, analytics, and integration examples, see **[Events Documentation](events.md)**.

## Data Structures

For comprehensive documentation of all data structures used in the 5reel smart contract system, see **[Data Structures Documentation](data-structures.md)**.

The system uses several key data structures including:
- **BankBalances**: Financial state tracking for the BankManager
- **SpinParams**: Configuration parameters for the SpinManager
- **PaylineMatch**: Results of payline matching against grids
- **Bet**: Individual bet records with metadata
- **Event Structures**: BetPlaced and BetClaimed events for tracking

## Payout System

The slot machine uses a symbol-based payout system with updated multipliers:

| Symbol | 3-in-a-row | 4-in-a-row | 5-in-a-row |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| A      | 200x        | 1000x       | 10000x      |
| B      | 60x         | 200x        | 1000x       |
| C      | 30x         | 100x        | 500x        |
| D      | 10x         | 55x         | 250x        |
| _      | 0x          | 0x          | 0x          |

## Paylines

The system includes 20 predefined paylines covering various patterns:

1. **Horizontal Lines**: Top, middle, and bottom rows
2. **V-Shapes**: Diagonal patterns
3. **Peaks and Valleys**: Center-focused patterns
4. **Zigzag Patterns**: Alternating row positions
5. **Additional Patterns**: Various combinations for increased winning opportunities

## Security Features

## Gas Optimization

The contracts use several optimization techniques:

- **OpUp**: Budget management for complex operations
- **Box Storage**: Efficient data storage using Algorand boxes
- **Subroutine Usage**: Code reuse and reduced deployment costs
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple paylines

## Deployment

### Bootstrap Requirements

Each contract has specific bootstrap costs:

- **SlotMachine**: ~71,200 microAlgos
- **SpinManager**: ~26,500 microAlgos
- **BankManager**: ~17,700 microAlgos
- **Ownable**: ~17,300 microAlgos
- **YieldBearingToken**: 100,000 microAlgos

### Box Storage

- Reel data and payline configurations
- Token balances and metadata

## Usage Examples

### Basic Slot Machine Usage

```typescript
// 1. Bootstrap the contract
await slotMachine.bootstrap({ payment: bootstrapCost });

// 2. Place a bet
const betKey = await slotMachine.spin({
    bet_amount: 1000000, // 1 VOI
    max_payline_index: 9, // Check 10 paylines
    index: 0,
    payment: 1000000 + spinCost + (10 * paylineCost)
});

// 3. Wait for claim round
// 4. Claim the bet
const payout = await slotMachine.claim({ bet_key: betKey });
```

### Yield Token Usage

```typescript
// 1. Bootstrap the token
await yieldToken.bootstrap();

// 2. Set name and symbol
await yieldToken.set_name("Submarine Gaming Token");
await yieldToken.set_symbol("GAME");

// 3. Set yield source
await yieldToken.set_yield_bearing_source(slotMachineAppId);

// 4. Deposit funds
const shares = await yieldToken.deposit({ payment: depositAmount + boxCost });

// 5. Withdraw funds
const amount = await yieldToken.withdraw(shares);
```
